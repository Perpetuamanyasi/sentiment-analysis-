# Sentiment Analysis of Brand Mentions on Twitter
#### Project Overview
Brand reputation and customer perception are key drivers of business success in today’s digital world. Social media platforms like Twitter have become essential for companies to gauge public opinion about their products and services. This project focuses on analyzing sentiments in tweets directed at major brands, specifically Apple and Google and their products, such as iPads, iPhones, Android devices, and related services.

Through sentiment analysis, we aim to classify customer feedback as positive, negative, or No emotion (neutral), providing valuable insights that can help businesses improve customer experience and brand positioning.
#### Business Problem
Companies like Apple and Google need to understand how consumers feel about their products in real time. Negative sentiments can indicate issues with product quality, customer service, or software performance, while positive sentiments highlight strengths and customer satisfaction.

By analyzing sentiment trends, companies can:

Identify brand strengths and leverage them for marketing.
Detect customer dissatisfaction early and address concerns.
Compare sentiment across different products and services.
Track public perception over time and adjust branding strategies.
Know which brands or products receive the most positive or negative sentiment
Understand What common themes appear in negative tweets, and how can they be addressed
#### Data Understanding
The dataset consists of tweets mentioning brands and their products, along with labeled sentiment categories. The key data attributes include:

tweet_text: The content of the tweet.
brand_sentiment: The sentiment label (Positive, Negative, or No emotion).
motion_in_tweet_is_directed_at: The specific brand or product being mentioned (e.g., iPad, iPhone, Google services).
tweet_length: The number of characters in the tweet.
Potential Data Challenges: Imbalanced Sentiment Distribution – More positive or neutral tweets compared to negative ones. Short Text Length – Tweets are often brief, making sentiment detection harder. Sarcasm & Context Ambiguity – Sentiment may be difficult to determine from text alone.

### Objective
The primary objective of this project is

To analyze sentiment in tweets related to Apple and Google brands to provide data-driven insights for business decision-making.
Classify sentiment as positive, negative, or No emotion(neutral).
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand sentiment trends.
Train and evaluate sentiment classification models using machine learning
Provide business recommendations based on sentiment trends and patterns.
### Metrics of Success
To evaluate the success of this sentiment analysis project, we will measure:

Sentiment Classification Accuracy – How well the model predicts sentiment correctly. Precision & Recall – To measure performance, especially in detecting negative sentiments accurately. Insight Quality – The ability to extract useful trends that help improve brand perception. Visualization Clarity – How well sentiment trends and patterns are communicated to stakeholders.
